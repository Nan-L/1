The Bootstrap Grid system helps you to create your layout and easily build a responsive website. There have not been any changes in the class names, except the .xs class, which no longer exists in Bootstrap 4.
  
The navbar wrapper is pretty cool in Bootstrap 4. It’s so helpful when it comes to building a responsive navbar.

Bootstrap 4 is a great option for building your web application. It delivers high quality of UI elements and it’s easy to customize, integrate and use. It will also help you to include responsiveness in your website, therefore delivering a premium user experience to your users.
